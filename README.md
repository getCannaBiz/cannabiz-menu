### We also have a WooCommerce solution

If you're looking for a WooCommerce solution for your dispensary website, we released the [Dispensary Details for WooCommerce](https://cannabizsoftware.com/product/dispensary-details-for-woocommerce/) plugin that adds all of the required cannabis related details to your WooCommerce store.

This plugin works independently of CannaBiz Menu, and is a perfect solution for you if you're already comfortable working with WooCommerce and don't want to learn a whole new system.
