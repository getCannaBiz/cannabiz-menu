## Dispensary Menu Features

WP Dispensary is packed with features to enhance the online presence of your cannabis business.

With WP Dispensary you are able to easily create an online menu for your patients to browse, and with the commercial add-on's offered, you can allow patients to place orders directly through your website!

### Menu page auto-created on installation

When you install and activate WP Dispensary, a new "Menu" page is automatically created for you, pre-populated with the default `[wpd_menu]` shortcode.

See all shortcode options in the [documentation](https://www.wpdispensary.com/section/shortcodes/)

## Define your dispensary style

[CannaBiz](https://www.wpdispensary.com/product/cannabiz) is a commercial WordPress theme for the cannabis industry, built and maintained by **WP Dispensary**.

Along with full integration for WP Dispensary and WooCommerce, CannaBiz focuses on page speed and easy to use customization options.

You can define your brand style through the theme Customizer by choosing the right colors and fonts, optimize the layout for your specific needs and give your patients a truly beautiful experience unlike anything your competitors offer.

This plugin works independently of WP Dispensary, and is a perfect solution for you if you're already comfortable working with WooCommerce and don't want to learn a whole new system.
