## Running tests

This plugin comes with unit tests. Running these tests requires you to setup a WordPress testing environment. [See the WordPress developers manual on how to set this up](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/automated-testing/phpunit/).

Once your environment is up and running, test by navigating to the plugins' folder and typing
`phpunit` in terminal.
